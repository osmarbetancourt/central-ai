> **üß† Note on Generative AI Modalities:**  
> While this stack focuses primarily on text-based LLMs, the same architectures and pipeline concepts apply to other generative AI systems, including:
>
> - **Text-to-Image:** (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL¬∑E, Midjourney)
> - **Image-to-Text:** (e.g., BLIP, CLIP, LLaVA)
> - **Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech:** (e.g., Whisper, Bark, Tortoise TTS)
> - **Image Generation, Video Generation, Audio Generation, Multimodal AI**
>
> These models often use transformer-based designs, but may involve different data pipelines, evaluation metrics, and integration strategies.  
> The stack layers (data governance, training, serving, context, agents, observability, etc.) are highly adaptable to these modalities‚Äîjust substitute your data types and models accordingly!

---

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è What are transformer-based architectures?**  
> Most modern LLMs (like GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, etc.), as well as many generative models for images, audio, and video, are built on the **transformer architecture**. Transformers are a type of deep learning neural network that use self-attention mechanisms to process data in parallel, making them extremely effective for modeling sequences (text, images, audio) and scaling to very large datasets and model sizes.
>
> The transformer architecture has largely replaced older neural network approaches (such as RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) for language and sequence modeling tasks, and has also inspired advances in vision and speech domains.
>
> **Traditional machine learning models** (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, decision trees) are now mainly used for simpler, highly structured, or low-data tasks (like tabular data analysis, basic classification, etc.), while deep learning‚Äîand especially transformers‚Äîdominate advances in generative AI, language, and perception.

## üß© Layer Annotations & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Data & Knowledge Governance:**  
  Foundation for both model training (Layers 0‚Äì1) and context retrieval (Layer 3 / RAG). Good governance ensures quality, compliance, and ethical usage at every stage.
- **Dynamic RAG & Tool Use:**  
  Modern RAG and agent systems can invoke backend tools/functions to fetch live or external data (web search, APIs, scraping, etc.), not just from static knowledge bases.
- **Layer of integration with user and reasoning:**  
  Begins at Layer 3 (RAG/Live Tools) and above.
- **Layer 6:**  
  This is where most commercial AIs (Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) operate.
- **Layers 0‚Äì2:**  
  Deep tech, only a few organizations operate here; most users and devs work at layers 3‚Äì7.
- **Security, privacy, and governance:**  
  Extremely important at all layers, especially when handling user data, model outputs, and integration.
- **Observability & Monitoring:**  
  Essential for production deployments (metrics, logging, tracing, error reporting, user feedback loops).
- **Deployment, DevOps & CI/CD:**  
  Critical for operationalizing, scaling, and maintaining AI systems across the stack.
